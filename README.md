# cnbc-stream-transcriber

A small command-line utility that

1. records CNBCâ€™s TuneIn HLS audio feed with **FFmpeg**  
2. cuts the stream into two-minute AAC segments  
3. transcribes each segment with **OpenAI Whisper**  
4. appends every transcript to a single rolling text file.

The project is designed for unattended, long-running use on any machine that supports Python 3.9+ and FFmpeg.
